# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of alternative installation providers for SAI, extending beyond traditional package managers to support source builds, binary downloads, and script-based installations. This feature will enable SAI to handle the three most common manual installation patterns developers encounter: building from source code, downloading pre-compiled binaries, and executing installation scripts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Source Provider Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build software from source code using SAI, so that I can install the latest versions or customize build configurations that aren't available in package managers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `sai install nginx --provider source` THEN SAI SHALL execute the complete source build workflow including download, extract, configure, build, and install steps
2. WHEN the source provider encounters missing prerequisites THEN SAI SHALL install required build tools and dependencies, asking user confirmation
3. WHEN I specify custom configure arguments in saidata THEN SAI SHALL use those arguments during the configure step
4. WHEN a source build fails THEN SAI SHALL execute rollback procedures to clean up partial installations
5. WHEN I use `sai uninstall nginx --provider source` THEN SAI SHALL remove all files installed from the source build
6. WHEN I use `sai upgrade nginx --provider source` THEN SAI SHALL backup the current installation, build the new version, and restore on failure
7. WHEN source builds use different build systems (autotools, cmake, make, meson, ninja) THEN SAI SHALL adapt the build commands appropriately
8. WHEN OS-specific source configurations exist THEN SAI SHALL use platform-appropriate build settings and prerequisites

### Requirement 2: Binary Download Provider

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to download and install pre-compiled binaries using SAI, so that I can quickly deploy software without compilation overhead or when package managers don't have the latest versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `sai install terraform --provider binary` THEN SAI SHALL download the binary from the specified URL with version templating support
2. WHEN downloading binaries THEN SAI SHALL verify checksums to ensure file integrity and security
3. WHEN binaries are compressed archives THEN SAI SHALL automatically extract them to the appropriate location
4. WHEN installing binaries THEN SAI SHALL set correct file permissions and place them in PATH-accessible locations
5. WHEN binary URLs include OS and architecture placeholders THEN SAI SHALL substitute appropriate values for the current system
6. WHEN I use `sai uninstall terraform --provider binary` THEN SAI SHALL remove the installed binary and any associated files
7. WHEN binary installations fail THEN SAI SHALL clean up partially downloaded or extracted files
8. WHEN multiple binary variants exist (different architectures, OS versions) THEN SAI SHALL select the appropriate variant automatically

### Requirement 3: Script Installation Provider

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute installation scripts using SAI, so that I can install software that provides custom installation scripts while maintaining SAI's unified interface and safety features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `sai install docker --provider script` THEN SAI SHALL download and execute the installation script with appropriate safety measures
2. WHEN downloading installation scripts THEN SAI SHALL verify checksums to prevent execution of tampered scripts
3. WHEN executing scripts THEN SAI SHALL provide environment variables and configuration options as specified in saidata
4. WHEN scripts require user interaction THEN SAI SHALL handle automatic confirmation when --yes flag is used
5. WHEN script execution fails THEN SAI SHALL execute rollback scripts if provided in the configuration
6. WHEN I use `sai uninstall docker --provider script` THEN SAI SHALL execute uninstall scripts or perform manual cleanup as configured
7. WHEN scripts modify system configuration THEN SAI SHALL track changes for potential rollback
8. WHEN script URLs are HTTPS THEN SAI SHALL enforce secure connections and certificate validation

### Requirement 4: Template Function Implementation

**User Story:** As a provider developer, I want comprehensive template functions for alternative installation methods, so that I can create flexible and reusable provider configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providers use `{{sai_source(0, 'field')}}` THEN SAI SHALL resolve source configuration fields with provider override support
2. WHEN providers use `{{sai_binary(0, 'field')}}` THEN SAI SHALL resolve binary download configuration with OS/architecture templating
3. WHEN providers use `{{sai_script(0, 'field')}}` THEN SAI SHALL resolve script configuration with environment variable support
4. WHEN template functions cannot resolve values THEN SAI SHALL disable the corresponding provider actions gracefully
5. WHEN OS-specific overrides exist THEN template functions SHALL prioritize platform-specific configurations
6. WHEN default values are needed THEN template functions SHALL generate sensible defaults based on software metadata
7. WHEN multiple sources/binaries/scripts are defined THEN template functions SHALL support index-based access
8. WHEN template resolution fails THEN SAI SHALL provide clear error messages indicating missing configuration

### Requirement 5: Schema and Type System Updates

**User Story:** As a saidata author, I want comprehensive schema support for alternative installation methods, so that I can define complete software configurations with validation and IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define sources in saidata THEN the schema SHALL validate build system types, URLs, and configuration options
2. WHEN I define binaries in saidata THEN the schema SHALL validate download URLs, checksums, and installation paths
3. WHEN I define scripts in saidata THEN the schema SHALL validate script URLs, environment variables, and rollback configurations
4. WHEN saidata files are loaded THEN SAI SHALL parse and validate all alternative installation configurations
5. WHEN provider-specific overrides are used THEN the type system SHALL support nested configuration inheritance
6. WHEN invalid configurations are detected THEN SAI SHALL provide specific validation errors with field-level details
7. WHEN OS-specific files are merged THEN the type system SHALL properly combine base and override configurations
8. WHEN new installation methods are added THEN the schema SHALL be extensible without breaking existing configurations

### Requirement 6: Integration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a SAI user, I want alternative installation providers to integrate seamlessly with existing SAI features, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of installation method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using alternative providers THEN SAI SHALL support all standard actions (install, uninstall, upgrade, version, info)
2. WHEN multiple providers are available THEN SAI SHALL allow provider selection via --provider flag
3. WHEN provider detection runs THEN SAI SHALL check availability of build tools, download utilities, and script interpreters
4. WHEN compatibility matrices are defined THEN SAI SHALL respect platform and architecture constraints
5. WHEN service management is needed THEN alternative providers SHALL integrate with existing service management functions
6. WHEN file and directory management is required THEN alternative providers SHALL use existing resource management systems
7. WHEN logging and debugging are enabled THEN alternative providers SHALL provide detailed execution information
8. WHEN dry-run mode is used THEN alternative providers SHALL show planned actions without executing them
